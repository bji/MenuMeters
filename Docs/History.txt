MenuMeters 1.1.1

* [BUG] Update to MenuCracker 1.3, fixes problems with home relative
	installations on Panther.
* [BUG] Fixed live menu update on Panther.
* [BUG] Fixed peak scaling calculation when user adjusts sample
	interval in the pref pane.
* [BUG] Fixed RAM calculations on machines with more than 2GB.
* [BUG] Corrected antialias control enable/disable in pref pane
	Memory controls.
* [BUG] Fix pixel offset in "opposed" mode received network graph.

MenuMeters 1.1

* [FEATURE] Added an installer to the project.
* [FEATURE] Limited compatibility with Mac OS 10.3 Panther (7B49).
	See the Known Issues section of the ReadMe for known
	limitations. Please bear in mind that Panther is still
	prerelease software.
* [FEATURE] Basic PPP control (connect/disconnect) now supported in
	the net meter for serial PPP and PPPoE interfaces.
* [FEATURE] Disk menu now allows selection from the menu to either
	open or eject/unmount the volume.
* [FEATURE] CPU meter supports inverted glow/pulse for the Griffin
	PowerMate (brighter glow/faster pulse as CPU usage drops).
* [FEATURE] Memory meter now has usage history graph for active,
	inactive and wired.
* [FEATURE] Net meter can now scale via interface speed or peak
	interface traffic. This offers better scaling for users with
	high speed interfaces connected to slow external connections
	(ex. 100Mbit Ethernet port connected to 1.5Kbps xDSL modem).
* [FEATURE] Net meter now offers multiple scaling functions (linear,
	square root, cube root, logarithmic).
* [BUG] Net meter throughput display width adjusted.
* [BUG] Fixed CPU temperature display enabling on some machines
	which support temperature readings but were accidentally
	disabled in the 1.0 release.
* [BUG] Fix processor temperature titling on multiprocessor
	machines.
* [BUG] Fix update of the Mem meter paging indicator when the menu
	is down.
* [BUG] Disk meter menu now supports Audio CD (cddafs) and DVD (ufs)
	filesystems.
* [BUG] Fix control enable/disable bugs in preference pane.
* [BUG] Fix lockup when displaying Mem meter menu content.
* [BUG] Fix display of serial PPP interfaces when the interface was
	selected as the preferred interface from the Net meter menu.

MenuMeters 1.0

* [FEATURE] Net meter now allows selection of displayed interface
	from the menu and preference pane.
* [FEATURE] CPU meter now supports the Griffin PowerMate. Thanks to
	Tim Brown (timb at gograywolf.com) for his assistance getting
	this done.
* [FEATURE] Mem meter menu now displays information about swap
	files, including swap files present, peak swap files (max seen
	since the meter loaded), swap location (supports relocated swap)
	and total swap space.
* [FEATURE] Added Processor temperature info to the CPU menu where
	supported. Note that many Mac models made between 2001-2003 do
	not support processor temperature. Also note that the
	temperature reported is only accurate to approximately +/- 20
	degrees. This is a limitation of the processor, and not a
	MenuMeters bug. Thanks to Mike Fischer (mike.fischer at
	fi-works.de) for pointing out more of my math dyslexia in C to F
	conversion.
* [FEATURE] Net graph can now be rendered in three styles, standard
	(same as previous releases), centered (graph radiates out from
	center line), and opposed (graph projects up and down from top
	and bottom edges of menubar).
* [FEATURE] CPU meter graph and thermometer display now include
	separate display color for nice'd processes.
* [FEATURE] Net meter now allows copying TCP/IP address to clipboard.
* [FEATURE] Net meter update interval can now be set as low as 0.5
	seconds (same as CPU meter.
* [FEATURE] Added bar-style (thermometer) display to the Memory
	meter. Patches contributed by Bernhard Baehr (bernhard.baehr at
	gmx.de).
* [FEATURE] Added optional pagein/pageout indicator to the Memory
	meter. Patches contributed by Bernhard Baehr (bernhard.baehr at
	gmx.de).
* [FEATURE] Added "Aqua" style disk LEDs to the disk activity meter.
	Contributed by Matthew Williamson.
* [FEATURE] Modified Memory meter to no longer include inactive
	pages in its "used" total. This is debatably incorrect as those
	pages are not "free" in the sense that vm_statistics_data_t
	means free, but it does better match user expectations who
	interpret the normal increase in inactive pages as a memory
	leak. To make the distinction more clear also moved memory usage
	into its own section of the Memory meter menu away from memory
	page statistics.
* [BUG] CPU percent user/system split display (small text) now
	ignores nice'd process load in order to match the method used by
	Darwin 'top'.
* [BUG] All meters now use NSNumberFormatters to localize number
	representations. This allows locale-based thousands and decimal
	separators. Fix based on patches provided by Mike Fischer
	(mike.fischer at fi-works.de).
* [BUG] Substantial internal changes to better support localization.
	Most format strings now exposed for localization. Menubar status
	labels for the Mem meter used/free display ("U:", "F:") and Net
	meter throughput display ("Tx:", "Rx:", "/s") are now
	localizable.
* [BUG] Preference panel UI changed to better follow Apple
	guidelines and make localization easier.
* [BUG] Preference file migrated from "MenuMeters.plist" to  proper
	app domain "com.ragingmenace.MenuMeters.plist".
* [BUG] Disk menu now uses NSWorkspace to open volumes instead of
	/usr/bin/open. This results in a slight speed improvement.
* [BUG] Workaround width/clipping issues when rendering
	non-antialiased text to the menubar status display in the Mem
	and Net meters.
* [BUG] Dynamically adjust Mem meter used/free display width to
	prevent clipping when the user has more than 1GB of RAM free.
* [BUG] Improve detection of G4 7455 (Apollo) and G3 750fx (Sahara)
	processors in the CPU name display in the CPU meter. Some 7455
	machines will still be identified as 7450s, this appears to be
	due to an Apple bug in gestaltNativeCPUtype. Since these same
	machines return correct Gestalt values in Classic we'll have to
	wait for Apple to fix it.
* [BUG] Performed tweaks to order and default colors of items in the
	memory pie graph. Graph now orders as active, wired, inactive,
	which seems more logical.
* [BUG] Fix CPU thermometer so that 100% load renders without blank
	space. Also fix so low system loads are not clipped by
	thermometer frame.
* [BUG] Fix negative throughput totals in Net meter when kernel
	internal net counters overflow. Caused by negative values from
	NSNumber's doubleValue method for NSNumbers containing unsigned
	long and unsigned long long values. See
	http://cocoa.mamasam.com/Mac OSXDEV/2002/09/1/44232.php
* [BUG] Fix bad system load total on multiprocessor machines using
	the "Average all processors" option.
* [BUG] Increased bounds checking paranoia.
* [LOCALE] German localization added, thanks to Mike Fischer
	(mike.fischer at fi-works.de).
* [LOCALE] Dutch localization added, thanks to Martijn van Exel
	(mvexel at xs4all.nl).

MenuMeters 0.7

* [FEATURE] Allow selection of large (menubar clock, 14pt), medium
	(11pt), or small (split user/system load 9pt) text font sizes
	for the percentage display in the CPU meter.
* [FEATURE] Added preference to CPU meter to allow multiprocessor
	machines to use a single display showing average of all
	processors.
* [FEATURE] Accepted Ben Jansen's patch to place throughput totals
	in the net meter in GB/MB/KB totals, not just bytes.
* [FEATURE] Added per interface throughput totals to the net meter
	menu, enabling you to see throughput on more than just the
	primary interface.
* [FEATURE] Added limited support for live menu updated in the net
	meter, specifically throughput and interface totals are now
	updated. The remaining data cannot be live updated both for
	performance reasons and because the menu might change length
	(see prior notes in the 0.6 changelog).
* [FEATURE] Added page fault and copy-on-write info to the Memory
	meter.
* [FEATURE] Added "Open Console" to the CPU menu.
* [FEATURE] Added more drive info (device name, file system type) to
	the disk menu.
* [BUG] Workaround what looks to be an Apple bug when reading
	outbound (upload) traffic on PPPoE interface. This appears to
	have been the cause of folks reporting "doubled" throughput
	totals. Fixed by using the underlying Ethernet interface
	directly instead of the pppconfd values. Thanks to Roberto
	Tremonti for the report and helping debug.
* [BUG] Workaround issue on some machines where the first MenuMeter
	from the right (first loaded) would fail because [NSBundle
	bundleForClass:[self class]] returned the SystemUIServer bundle
	instead of the menu extra. Thanks to Cédric Honegger and Tim
	Brown for their assistance.
* [BUG] Fix overflow problems for network stats in the net meters.
	Thanks to Ben Jansen for the report.
* [BUG] Fix unnecessary rewrite of pref file when no data has
	changed.
* [BUG] Make localization of disk icon set names easier.
* [BUG/WORKAROUND] Document conflict between CPU.menu (from Apple
	CHUD tools) and MenuCracker. Check the Known Issues section of
	the ReadMe for details. Thanks to David Wood for his assistance.
* [LOCALE] Japanese localization added, thanks to "(@_@)yooo"
	(webmaster at xiv-view.com).

MenuMeters 0.6

* [FEATURE] By popular demand, the Net meter now allows you to hide
	the activity arrows.
* [FEATURE] Menubar status displays now update even when their
	associated menu is down.
* [FEATURE] Status related menu items for the CPU and Memory meters
	are now updated even when the menu is down (uptime, for example,
	keeps ticking). Also lowered the default memory display time to
	10 seconds (from 15) to make this "live" update more obvious.
	Note that leaving the menu down and updating will increase the
	amount of CPU time used by SystemUIServer. The Net and Disk
	menus cannot be made to dynamically update because they do not
	have a fixed number of items. The Mac OS menu manager can't
	handle dynamically resizing menus while they are displayed (not
	really their fault, this is a very weird thing to do, and is
	against Apple's usual guidelines for menu behavior).
* [FEATURE] Added per-interface traffic totals to the Net config
	menu for interfaces where those values are known. These values
	are the cumulative totals maintained by the Mac OS X networking
	layer and cannot be manually reset (though a reboot will reset
	them).
* [FEATURE] Enabled hiding of labels in the Memory meter status
	display ("U:", "F:") and the Net meter throughput display
	("Tx:", "Rx:"). This narrows the menu slightly for those who
	need those extra pixels.
* [FEATURE] Added a (very narrow) "thermometer" style CPU graph
	which can be used alone or in conjunction with the other CPU
	displays.
* [FEATURE] Got rid of the "Apply", "Revert", etc. buttons in the
	pref pane. Pane now updates the meters live.
* [FEATURE] Net meter now allows users to set a lower bound of
	1K/sec for throughput display.
* [BUG] Corrected totally bogus throughput calculation in the net
	meter affecting all update intervals except 1 second. Had the
	math backwards, how embarrassing. Thanks to Henryk Richter for
	the patch. Unless someone tells me different I'm going to assume
	this is why some folks believed that the display was in bits per
	second, not bytes per second (it has always been bytes per
	second, it was just wrong).
* [BUG] CPU meter now correctly shows load of "nice"-ed processes
	such as the Seti@Home daemon. More bad math on my part. Thanks
	to Tom Varga for the report.
* [BUG] Net meter now correctly detects the speed of a serial PPP
	interface and reports it both in the Net Meter menu config
	description (when connected) and uses it for the scaling of the
	Net meter arrows and graph.
* [BUG] For PPP connections worked around an issue where sysctl did
	not return received bytes for the ppp interface (always reported
	0 bytes received). Corrected by talking directly to pppconfd for
	status information.
* [BUG] Menubar status displays for Net Meter (graph, arrows, and
	throughput) are now calculated on the basis of throughput on the
	primary network interface only. This was a deliberate limitation
	of 0.5, but has now been removed.
* [BUG] Net meter config menu should now catch PPP serial
	connect/disconnect and update configuration info appropriately.
* [BUG] Resized Net meter throughput to be as small as possible
	while still being wide enough to hold four digit ("200.1KB/s"
	for example) strings.
* [BUG] Fixed problems with stale disk names in the Disk meter's
	volume list. This was most noticeable when mounting/unmounting
	CDs, all CDs would have the name of the first CD mounted
	regardless of which CD was in the drive at the time. Bug looks
	to be caused by NSFileManager problems in SystemUIServer,
	workaround was to switch to Carbon volume info calls.
* [BUG] Fixed title of the color arrow imageset in the Disk meter to
	include a space ("Color Arrows" instead of "ColorArrows").
* [LOCALE] French localization added, thanks to Matt Anton
	(menumeters at syrius.org).
